# Fuel Station Data Analysis

## Overview

This project involves data analysis of fuel station data using the R programming language. The data is accessed through a REST API provided by the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Tourism of Spain.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to perform data cleaning, analysis, and visualization tasks to gain insights into fuel prices across different regions of Spain.

## Repository Contents

- **`gas_stations_analysis.R`**: This file contains the R script that performs the data analysis. It includes data loading from the REST API, data cleaning, descriptive statistics calculation, and data visualization using libraries such as `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, and `leaflet`.

- **`codccaa_OFFCIAL.xls`**: An Excel file provided by the National Institute of Statistics (INE) containing codes and names of the autonomous communities of Spain. It is used to add the name of the autonomous community to the fuel station data.

## Requirements

To run the R script, you will need to have R installed on your local machine, along with additional libraries such as `tidyverse`, `leaflet`, `jsonlite`, among others. You will also need an Internet connection to access the data from the REST API.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `gas_stations_analysis.R` file in your R development environment.
3. Execute the script line by line or in its entirety to perform the data analysis.
4. Explore the results of the analysis and the generated visualizations.
